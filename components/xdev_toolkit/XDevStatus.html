<LI><B>20110116 release:</B>
<UL>
<LI>DfmToLfm now supports converting a Lazarus form file too, as a way
to create more than one version of the same form, for example to conditionally
include a different version based on widgetset target. For example, you could
do this in a form's unit:
<PRE>
{$IFNDEF LCLCarbon}
 {$R *.lfm}  //include generic form with Windows and Linux
{$ELSE}
 {$R *.mac.lfm}  //include prettied form with Mac (-m -s switches)
{$ENDIF}
</PRE>
</UL>
<LI>20101230 release:
<UL>
<LI>Added -s switch to DfmToLfm (substitutes fonts).
</UL>
<LI>20101117 release:
<UL>
<LI>Added files from "Making Your Lazarus App Mac-Friendly" article.
<LI>Added -m switch to DfmToLfm (Mac prettifier).

<A name="CodeConverters"></A><H3>MakePasX & DfmToLfm: Delphi converters</H3>

These two utilities are provided for converting Delphi projects to Lazarus
and optionally maintaining the project's forms on both Delphi and Lazarus.
The MakePasX utility is used to make Delphi code files cross-platform (.dpr
and .pas). The DfmToLfm utility is used to create Lazarus form design files 
(.lfm) from Delphi form design files (.dfm).<p>

Once you've converted a Delphi app to Lazarus you can continue to
develop the app with Delphi on Windows and use Lazarus to compile 
the app on other platforms. This type of app can provide the best of both 
worlds: taking advantage of the speed, stability and Windows-specific features
of Delphi while utilizing Free Pascal and Lazarus to add cross-platform capability
to the app.

<OL>
<LI>Make a copy of the Delphi files you want to convert in a different directory 
since MakePasX will alter the source code files.<P>

<LI>Use the MakePasX utility to make the Delphi project file (.dpr) and form 
code files (.pas) cross-platform. This is a one-time conversion that results 
in a set of source files that can be compiled by both Delphi and Lazarus.
Examples:<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;makepasx myprogram.dpr<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;makepasx myform.pas<P>
MakePasX tries to insert the conditionals needed to compile with Lazarus, while 
retaining compatibility with Delphi. After converting you can test to see that 
the files can still be compiled by Delphi. You may have to make minor manual adjustments 
if the converter couldn't figure out your code. Also, you can look at the source 
code of the converter to see what it's doing.<P>

<LI>Use the DfmToLfm utility to create a Lazarus form file (.lfm) from each Delphi 
form file (.dfm). Example:<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dfmtolfm myform.dfm<P>
This creates an .lfm file that should be compatible with Lazarus. With Linux you
can use the -d switch to delete the font names from the .lfm file. This generally 
makes for a better look on Linux, which doesn't have the same TrueType fonts that 
Windows and OS X have. Default fonts will be substituted at runtime. With Windows 
you can use the -p switch to add a parent's font to controls with no font, 
which generally makes for a better look on Windows.<P>
Important! Make sure your .dfm files are text files. If not, save them as text 
files with Delphi before attempting to convert them.<P>

<LI>Use the Lazarus LazRes utility to create a Lazarus resource file (.lrs)
from each form file (.lfm). Example:<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lazres myform.lrs myform.lfm<P>
Note: The lazres source code is located in the Lazarus tools folder. Open
project file lazres.lpi in Lazarus and compile it in the IDE.<P>

<LI>Repeat steps 3 and 4 whenever you make changes to the Delphi form files.
If your project has a number of forms, run DfmToLfm and LazRes 
for each form in a batch or shell file to automate the conversion.<P>

<LI>Open the converted .dpr file with Lazarus and allow it to create a project
file (.lpi), then compile the project with Lazarus 
to test the converted code and form files.<P>

Tip: If you run your Lazarus-compiled app and get an error message about an unknown 
property, that probably means you need to add this property to the [DeleteProps]
section of dfmtolfm.ini file and rerun DfmToLfm on the .dfm file. Not all VCL components
have been tested with DfmToLfm.<P>

<LI>Move the Lazarus project's files over to other platforms and compile and 
test them there with those platforms' version of Lazarus.
</OL>


<HR>
<A name="VersionInfo"></A><H3>MakeVer: Create a version info file</H3>

This simple utility extracts version information from a Delphi .dof file and
creates an INI-style .version file that can be distributed with a Lazarus app.<BR><BR>

<HR>
<A name="HelpConverter"></A><H3>CvtHelp & HelpUtil: Convert WinHelp RTF to HTML</H3>

The CvtHelp utility can be used to convert a WinHelp RTF help file
to an HTML file that can be used in a Lazarus app that uses the HelpUtil unit.

<OL>
<LI>Use Word to save the WinHelp RTF file to a "Web Page, Filtered" HTML file. 
For example, open myapp.rtf and save it as myapp.htm.<P>
<LI>Run CvtHelp on the resulting HTML file and the WinHelp help project (.hpj)
file. For example:<P>
cvthelp myapp.htm myapp.html
<LI>Add the HelpUtil unit to the uses section of your Lazarus app's main form.<P>
<LI>In your main form's FormCreate handler:<P>
Application.HelpFile := ChangeFileExt(ParamStr(0), '.html');<P>
HelpManager := THelpUtilManager.Create;
<LI>In your main form's FormDestroy handler:<P>
HelpManager.Free;
<LI>To invoke help, add something like this to a menu command or button OnClick
handler:<P>
Application.HelpContext(1); 
</OL>

For more information, refer to the CvtHelp and HelpUtil source code.<BR><BR>

<HR>
<A name="OSXscripts"></A><H3>OS X scripts: Create an app bundle</H3>

This script (create_app_mac.sh) creates an .app bundle (folder) for an executable 
created with Lazarus and its Carbon widgetset so you can double-click the app 
to start it or drag and drop the app on the dock.<P>

<UL>
<LI>Before using this script, make sure you've made it executable:<P>

chmod +x create_app_mac.sh<P>

<LI>Example: Your executable is file myapp and you want to create an .app bundle 
for it named My Application.app:<P>

./create_app_mac.sh myapp "My Application"<P>
</UL>

For more information or to customize this script for a specific app, 
open it in a text editor and read the comments.<P>

<HR>
<A name="RTF"></A><H3>RtfDoc & ViewDoc: RTF document creation and viewing</H3>

With Delphi, you can use a TRichEdit control to create, display and allow the 
user to edit simple documents in Rich Text Format (RTF). TRichEdit is a wrapper 
around the Windows RICHED32.DLL library that's also used by Windows WordPad 
to create and edit RTF files. RTF is a well-documented text format that's 
fully supported by Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.org.<P>

TRichEdit is a handy control for creating or displaying simple reports, 
but if you try to use it for more than that you will be quickly disappointed 
because TRichEdit has serious limitations. For one thing, Borland never added 
support to TRichEdit for newer versions of the Rich Edit library (RICHED20.DLL). 
And although it's possible to hack the Delphi ComCtrls unit to add support 
for RICHED20.DLL, Microsoft never fixed some of the bugs in this library 
or supported more than just a subset of RTF.<P>

Since Lazarus is a cross-platform tool, it doesn't provide a TRichEdit control. 
And even if it did, this type of control might not meet your needs. After all, 
TRichEdit is trying to be a word processor, something the creators of Word 
and OpenOffice.org have spent many years developing. Wouldn't it make more 
sense just to use an actual word processor to create and display reports?

<H4>Using TRtfParser to create RTF documents</H4>

With Windows, the easiest way to control a word processor externally from 
another program is to start the Word or OpenOffice.org Automation server 
and use the server to create, manipulate and display documents. But this 
is a Windows-only solution; OS X and Linux don't have an equivalent to 
Windows Automation.<P>

Fortunately Free Pascal includes a unit named RtfPars that includes the 
TRtfParser class. While this class was designed to parse and proof existing 
RTF documents, you can also run it "backwards" to create RTF documents as well.<P>

To simplify use of the TRtfParser class, the XDev Toolkit includes unit RtfDoc, 
which introduces a TRtfParser descendant, TRtfDoc, which can be used 
to create RTF files without knowing how TRtfParser works. For information 
on how to use it, look at the RtfDoc.pas file and TestRtfDoc.pas example 
program. You'll also want to look at the Free Pascal rtfdata.inc file for 
a list of constants that you'll need to use with TRtfDoc (rtfdata.inc is
in Free Pascal's /packages/fcl-base/src/inc folder).<P>

For more information on the RTF specification, refer to Microsoft's documentation.<P>

<H4>Using Word and OpenOffice.org to display RTF documents</H4>

Assuming you can create your RTF report document as described in the previous 
section, you now need a way to display it with a word processor. With Windows, 
you would probably start the Word or OpenOffice.org Automation server, load 
the report document, then make the program visible so the user can browse, 
edit, print or save the report. To do this in a cross-platform way, you can 
instead shell to the word processor and pass the report file name on the 
command line. Here are the steps:

<UL>
<LI>Determine that the word processor exists and the location of its executable.
<LI>Start the word processor by shelling to it, passing it the name of the RTF 
report document.
<LI>Clean up.
</UL>

The XDev Toolkit includes unit ViewDoc, which takes care of most of the details.
The first two steps are handled by its ViewDocument function, to which you pass
the document name and which word processor to use (Word or OO) and let it 
determine the word processor's location and launch it. The clean-up step is 
handled by the unit's DeleteViewedDocs function. For more information on how 
to use these functions, look at file ViewDoc.pas and ViewWith.pas, a test 
program that uses the ViewDoc unit.<P>

Why would you need to clean up after launching the word processor? Usually 
this step is necessary because the report document will be a temporary file 
that you'll want to delete. You probably shouldn't require your users to name 
each report document that your program creates. This will quickly annoy them; 
it also forces your users to clean up the clutter of saved report documents. 
Instead, you should use the GetTempFilename function (in the Lazarus FileUtil 
unit) to get a file name to use for your temporary file, then delete this file 
yourself at some point after launching the word processor. (Don't use the same 
file name for all reports since this will restrict your users to viewing only 
one report at a time.)<P>

But how can you delete a file if it's open in another program? Remember, your 
word processor is running externally to your program and locks the file as 
long as it's open. The file and the word processor won't be closed until the 
user decides to close them. And even if the file has already been closed, 
are you sure you want to delete it? What if your user made changes to the 
report and saved it?<P>

The solution that ViewDocument uses is to start the word processor with 
a switch that tells it to create a new document based on the report file 
(that is, using it as a template). ViewDocument can also add the report file 
to a list of temporary files to be deleted when your program shuts down. Even 
though your program still can't delete the temporary file as long as the new
document based on it is open in the word processor, this does mean that if
the user saves the new document, it won't be with the report file's name.<P>

To delete the temporary files created by your program, call the DeleteViewedDocs
function in your main form's FormCloseQuery handler. If DeleteViewedDocs 
returns False, you can remind your user to save or close any reports still 
open in the word processor. DeleteViewedDocs is also called by the ViewDoc 
unit's finalization code to clean up whatever it can when the program finally 
does shut down.<P>

One final note: With OS X, the normal way to start a program from a terminal 
command line or when shelling is to use the Open command. Unfortunately, the
only parameter that Open passes along to the program is the name of the file 
to open, so there's no way to pass any switches to Word or NeoOffice. With OS X, 
ViewDocument instead sets the temporary report file to read-only, thus forcing 
the user to use a different name when saving the report. A disadvantage of this 
approach is that the word processor shows the name of the temporary file in 
the title bar (for example, rpt1.tmp) rather than Document1 or Untitled1 as it 
normally does with a new document. ViewDocument also uses this approach with
AbiWord, which doesn't appear to support a command line template switch.
