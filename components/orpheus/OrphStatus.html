<UL>
<LI>20070425 release (0.1.4):
  <UL>
  <LI>Recent changes to Lazarus LCL broke compilation of Orpheus. This
      release can now be compiled with the latest LCL.<P>
  </UL>
<LI>20070401 release (0.1.3):
  <UL>
  <LI>Improvements to TO32FlexEdit on Windows.<P>
  </UL>
<LI>20070317 note:
  <UL>
  <LI>Recent improvements in the Lazarus Carbon widgetset add basic functionality
      for several Orpheus controls on OS X (see table below).<P> 
  </UL>
<LI>20070211 note:
  <UL>
  <LI>Recent improvements in Lazarus fix display of custom cursor when 
      sizing and moving columns and rows at runtime in TOvcTable.<P> 
  </UL>
<LI>20070204 release (0.1.2):
  <UL>
  <LI>Workarounds found for recent Lazarus changes that broke TOvcTable Columns
      and Rows editors.
  <LI>Workaround found for recent FPC 2.1.1 change that broke compilation of ovcvlb.pas.<P>
  </UL>
<LI>20070128 release (0.1.1):
  <UL>
  <LI>An example program that demos the TO32FlexEdit control has been added
      even though validation doesn't work with LCL (see "To Do" list below).
      If you have Delphi you can compile the example to see how validation
      is supposed to work.
  <LI>Recent changes in Lazarus on Windows appear to have broken both the 
      Columns and Rows design-time property editors for the TOvcTable control. 
      The property editors still work with OS X. Stay tuned...
  <LI>Custom cursors are now visible when resizing table columns at runtime on
      Windows. However, cursor also disappears sometimes. Stay tuned on 
      this one too...<P>
  </UL>
<LI>20070127 note:
  <UL>
  <LI>Recent improvements in the Lazarus Qt widgetset make a couple of Orpheus controls
      work better with Qt.<P>
  </UL>
<LI>20070115 note:
  <UL>
  <LI>In addition to downloading the .zip file (see link below), you can now
      also obtain the Orpheus ported source using Subversion:<P>
      svn co https://lazarus-ccr.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lazarus-ccr/components/orpheus [local_dir]
  </UL>
<LI>20070114 note:
  <UL>
  <LI>Controls have now been tested with GTK2 widgetset (see table below).<P>
  </UL>
<LI>20070107 release (0.1.0):
  <UL>
  <LI>TOvcVirtualListBox control added.
  <LI>Installation no longer registers TOvcSimpleField and TOvcTCSimpleField 
  controls (see myovcreg.pas) on non-Windows platforms since these two controls
  don't work on other platforms and crash Lazarus IDE if added to a form on 
  those platforms.

<A name="Introduction"></A><H3>Introduction</H3>

These notes describe the status of the OrphPort Project, an attempt to
port a subset of TurboPower's Orpheus controls to <A HREF="http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org">Lazarus</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.freepascal.org">Free Pascal</A>. At this time,
several <B>enhanced label controls</B> and most of the <B>table (grid) controls</B>
have been ported. Some of the controls
work quite well on multiple platforms; others need more work or
await better support by the Lazarus LCL or by specific widgetsets before
they are fully functional. The table below gives the status of individual 
controls. You are encouraged to work on improving these controls
(see <A HREF="#To_Do">To Do list</A>). Please send your bug reports, suggestions 
and patches to:<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;MacPgmr (at) fastermac (dot) net<P>

<I>Note:</I> You can also post to the "Ported from Delphi/Kylix" section of the Lazarus
forum if you want your bug reports and suggestions to be seen by the entire
Lazarus community.<P>

The ported source code is here: <A HREF="http://web.fastermac.net/~MacPgmr/OrphPort/downloads">http://web.fastermac.net/~MacPgmr/OrphPort/downloads</A><P>   

The original Orpheus 4.06 source code that this port was based on is here:

<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tporpheus">http://sourceforge.net/projects/tporpheus</A>
(although you don't need this for Lazarus)<p>

TurboPower's 1,392-page Orpheus User's Manual is also available from the Source Forge site.<P>

Note that the ported source remains under the original MPL 1.1 license.

<OL>
<LI>Unzip the ported source files into their own folder.
<LI>Start Lazarus.
<LI>Optionally, choose File | New | Application to make sure Lazarus doesn't
mess up the currently open project.
<LI>Choose Component | Open package file and select orpheus.lpk.
<LI>Click Compile to make sure your version of Lazarus can compile the
Orpheus units.
<LI>Click Install and click Yes when prompted to rebuild the Lazarus IDE.
<LI>After rebuilding is finished, restart Lazarus if it didn't restart
automatically. The installed Orpheus controls will be on the Orpheus tab
of the component palette.
</OL>

<I>Important!</I> If you don't have write access to the folder where Lazarus
is installed, you may have problems rebuilding the Lazarus IDE with older
versions of Lazarus. However, if you have a relatively new version of Lazarus, 
it will compile itself to the ~/.lazarus/bin folder if you don't have write 
access to the Lazarus install folder. After rebuilding, be sure to start 
~/.lazarus/bin/lazarus, not the installed Lazarus.<P>

The source for several small test applications is included which demonstrates
most of the ported controls. Open each test app's .lpi file and compile it once
Orpheus has been installed in Lazarus. Folders for the test apps are located
in the <I>tests</I> folder in your Orpheus folder, as follows:
<UL>
<LI>TestTable - demos TOvcTable and various table cell controls (column
headers, row labels, string, memo, check box, combo box, bitmap).
<LI>TestURL - demos TOvcURL
<LI>TestRLbl - demos TOvcRotatedLabel
<LI>TestLabel - demos TOvcLabel
<LI>TestVLB - demos TOvcVirtualListBox
</UL>

To see the TOvcSpinner control in action, try out the table's Rows and Columns
property editors with the TestTable app.<P>

<I>Note:</I> The TestTable app uses the included .bmp files to demo the
TOvcTCBitMap control. These bitmap files are not needed to rebuild the Lazarus
IDE since they're in the ovcreg.lrs resource file, but they are
included for completeness.<p> 

<I>Tip:</I> The necessary files for compiling the test apps with Delphi are
also included (.dof, .dfm, .bdsproj). If you have Delphi you can compile 
the apps to see exactly how the Orpheus controls are supposed to look and
behave. Note that with the free Turbo Delphi Explorer you can't install
Orpheus (a limitation of the free version). However, you can still compile
the test apps, as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Start Turbo Delphi Explorer and open the test app's .bdsproj file.
<LI>Click Ignore All to proceed when Delphi encounters the unrecognized
Orpheus controls.
<LI>Choose File | Close and click Cancel to close the main form.
<LI>Choose Project | Options and make sure the Search path in 
Directories/Conditionals points to your Orpheus folder. 
<LI>Choose Project | Compile to compile the test app.
</UL>

<A name="Porting_Philosophy"></A><H3>Porting Philosophy</H3>

<UL>
<LI>All changes to the original source code were made via conditional
compiling (IFDEF's). Thus the ported source retains full Delphi compatibility.
An added benefit is that you can see what the original code was, something
that is often lost with ported code.
<LI>A compatibility unit, <I>MyMisc</I>, was added to fill in gaps in the 
Lazarus LCL and provide other compatibility routines.
<LI>Orpheus functions written in assembly were "Pascal-ized" so the ported code could
be compiled on non-Intel platforms.
<LI>For now, the Lazarus package (orpheus.lpk) compiles the source with range, 
overflow and stack checking turned on. This revealed several apparently harmless
bugs in the TurboPower code, which have been fixed. To find these and other
minor bugs, grep the source for "TurboPower bug".
<LI>In general, no other significant changes or "improvements" were made to 
the source. An exception is the o32tcflx unit, where a few additions were
made to correct apparent omissions or inconsistencies.
<LI>A note on comments: Comments added to the ported source are generally
marked with "//". However, the "o32" units (developed later than other units
by TurboPower) already included some "//" comments. With these units, you can
tell the added comments by their context (near IFDEF's, for example). 
</UL>

<HR>
<A name="Usage_Notes"></A><H3>Usage Notes</H3>

<OL>
<LI>When you first add an Orpheus control to a form, Lazarus will add
the Orpheus unit to the uses section of your main source file (.lpr). 
This pulls in a great deal of code that you don't need. Delete the Orpheus unit
from the uses section to reduce the size of your executable file.<P>
<LI>Several of the ported controls are not supported by the GTK widgetset
(see table below). Don't use these controls in cross-platform applications.
Just opening a form that has a TOvcSimpleField or TOvcTCSimpleField control
on it will likely crash the Lazarus IDE with GTK. Use the 
TO32FlexEdit and TO32TCFlexEdit controls in place of TOvcSimpleField and 
TOvcTCSimpleField controls in cross-platform applications.<P>
<LI>To display the TOvcLabel's Style Manager property editor in the Lazarus 
IDE, right-click on the TOvcLabel control (Apple key+click on Mac). You can
also change Style Manager properties via the CustomSettings in the
Object Inspector. Also, with GTK, the default clNone Color displays a black
background, so be sure to set ParentColor to True or select a different 
Color.<P>
<LI>An added benefit of the Orpheus TOvcSpinner control is that it is 
available for Delphi too, unlike the LCL TSpinEdit, which has no equivalent
in the Delphi VCL.
</OL>

<HR>
<A name="Limitations"></A><H3>Limitations</H3>

<OL>
<LI>The TO32FlexEdit and TO32TCFlexEdit controls include code for displaying
an optional button within the text editing area. However, this TBitBtn-within- 
a-TEdit is not supported by the LCL, so the code has been IFDEF'd out for now. 
If this is ever supported by the LCL, defining ButtonOkay in o32flxed.pas 
is all that's needed to enable the button code.<P>
<LI>Widgetsets generally implement LCL controls by creating native controls
that correspond to the LCL controls (text edit, check box, etc.). However,
Orpheus builds its TOvcSimpleField control from TCustomControl, rather than
descending from an existing edit control such as TCustomEdit. This sort of
edit control does not appear to be supported by the GTK widgetset.<P>
<LI>The GTK and Carbon widgetsets do not support TOvcRotatedLabel, apparently
because the GetTextMetrics function is not fully implemented on those
widgetsets.

(1) "Working" means control is basically functional. "Partial" means
control compiles, installs in IDE and displays at run-time, but doesn't function
correctly. "Not working" means control compiles and installs in IDE but
doesn't display correctly. "Widgetset doesn't support" means the widgetset 
currently does not provide the support needed for the control.<BR>
(2) TOvcSimpleField and TOvcTable require a TOvcController on form.
