  clipboard and drag and drop ole under ifdefs
* added {$mode delphi}{$H+}

* Add Types unit (TSize)
* THintWindow.IsHintMsg is not implemented in LCL. Comment the code

* Replaced  RegisterClipboardFormat by ClipboardRegisterFormat
* Added win32 color constants
* Removed ISWin2k and XP since was not used. Assume IsWinNt true
* Removed Global HintFont var used to < Delphi4. Use Screen.HintFont.

#Major Tasks#
< > General Painting
  [*] The NodeBitmap width/Height is not reseted when erasing the background > LCL bug
< > Define the UNICODE support schema. Probably change from widestring to ansistring and let LCL do the rest
  [ ] Use GetTextExtentPoint instead of GetTextExtentPoint32 since the later is a wrapper to the former in LCL
  [ ] For now all rendering will be done with DrawTextW wrapper > Windows.DrawTextW
< > Find a way to mantain OLE drag and Drop in windows
  [ ] Also maintain OLE ClipBoard?? Necessary??
< > Replace TWMTimer since is only called in win32. Or implement in GTK Intf?
< > Implement Imagelist handling
  [ ] See a properly way to setup the ImageLists (avoid current hack)
< > GetCurrentObject used for blending does not exists in LCL. Add it?
  [ ] Gtk.GetObject does not return dmBits (is always nil) -> Is not viable to implement
      GetObject under Gtk. See another way to do alpha blend (Disable in GTK??)
< > Implement the header
  [ ] BevelEdges is used to paint the Header. See if is worth implementing it
  [ ] Process the header messages or do another way
  [ ] See if DestroyWindowHandle is necessary in Destroy
< > Bidi Support
  [ ]Properly Implement TBaseVirtualTree.UseRightToLeftAlignment
#Secondary Tasks#
< > (low) OleAcc: MSAA (Accessibility)
<*> WMContextMenu: replace by DoContextPopup??. Add to LCL??
  [*] Fix Double MouseRUp
  [*] in line 2042 of callback simplify
<-> pceltFetched in TEnumFormatEtc.Next is declared as ULong in fpc but PLongInt in Delphi
  [*] Already reported. No response
< > Implement THintWindow.IsHintMsg ?
< > Add TLMEnable ??
< > Replace WMSetFont since LM_SETFONT is not used in LCL
<*> Replace RaiseLastOSError. Is used in only one place -> Removed
< > IsWinNT is currently set to True. See if will support win98 and how do it
< > See what todo with GetTextAlign. Implement in LCL??
< > Thread support
  [ ] Replace TVTCriticalSection by SyncObjs.TCriticalSection??
  [ ] See appropriate value for INFINITE constant in Linux/BSD etc
< > TWorkerThread.ChangeTreeStates uses SendMessage. See if it works both in win and linux
<-> In fpc TStgMedium records have PunkForRelease instead of unkForRelease, same for stm and stg
  [*] Already reported. No response
< > Add a way to replace TBitmap.Scanline and all advanced graphics routines
  [ ] Use TLazIntfImage?
  [ ] Properly implement CreatePatternBrush or find a way to paint the lines
< > Implement GetBkColor in LCL
< > Begin/EndUpdate uses WM_SETREDRAW  message to avoid painting. See a crossplatform way of doing it
<*> Translate MAKEROP4 from C to Pascal. Done copied from fpc
< > TCMMouseWheel type is not used in Lazarus. Remove
< > Revise CM* functions and messages
< > Implement SubtractRect
< > Implement WMSetFont
< > Implement PackArray using asm
  [ ] Wait for fpc2.2
  [ ] Adapt for fpc
  [ ] Create versions for not i386

#Checks#
< > See if getting the length of PWideChar by typecasting to WideString is correct
< > See if the Hint is being show in the correct place
< > See the effect of using RecreateWnd (in TCustomVirtualTreeOptions.SetMiscOptions)
<*> WM_NCPAINT: see the behavior under LCL
  [*] Is not handled. TControl will never receive it
< > TVMGet* functions: probably it can be ignored, since is windows specific and not necessary at all
< > See if WM_COPY can be mapped to LM_COPYTOCLIP
< > See WM_ENABLE,WM_GETDLGCODE behavior under lcl/win32
< > See function of WM_GETOBJECT and if is necessary to add to LCL
< > See the difference between TWMPaint and TLMPaint
< > TWMPrint and WM_PRINT. See if is necessary
< > In SetCursor uses TLMessage. Investigate
< > See if GetRGBColor is necessary. Probably not. If so remove color constants
< > Found no way to replace ValidateRect in Hint Window animation. See how to replace it
< > See if the typecasts to longword in TVirtualTreeColumn.LoadFromStream is correct
< > See te meaning of Bevel* properties. See what values it should be in LCL
<*> See if custom MapWindowPoints is returning correct values
  [*] AFAIK yes
< > See if Application.ProcessMessages in InterruptValidation will work (WM_QUIT handling??)
<*> See if windows.GetUpdateRect is equal to PaintStruct in WM Paint
  [*] Yes and no. The values of GetUpdateRect and rcPaint is equal in most times. So is safe to use it
      But GetUpdateRect will always return an empty Rect when called inside LM_PAINT because there's a
      prior BeginPaint call
< > In TWMKillfocus the code to nullify the active control is probably not necessary
< > See if DeleteObject is necessary in AdjustCursorPanning
< > See if WHEEL_ constants are valids under gtk
< > See if is necessary WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE
< > See if is necessary handle LM_SETCURSOR (not used in LCL)
< > See how replace CreateParams
< > See if Canvas Respect TextStyle properties and if is necessary to set the bk in PaintNormalText
< > IStream.SetSize expects ULARGE_INTEGER instead of LARGE_INTEGER
< > Remove  TRect copy in FillRect
< > In paint tree avoid using TBitmap.Canvas since it does a check each time is called
< > Why there's a extra 1 in the NodeBitmap that clears the backGround
< > See code duplicate in TBitmap.SetWidthHeight
< > Document problem of TCanvas.Color
< > Document differences between WMMouseWheel
< > Document Differences between WMPaint
< > Document that ScrollWindow does not exists in gtk
< > Due to lclheader implementation, when a editor is scrolled out of the window it disppears (does not returns when scroled back)
