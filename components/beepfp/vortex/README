LibVortex library for Free Pascal
Version 1.1.1 svn r4012

Copyright (C) 2009, Wimpie Nortje <wimpienortje@gmail.com>

Introduction
------------
This package is a Free Pascal translation of the libvortex header files.

LibVortex is a BEEP (RFC3080/RFC3081) implementation in C. To learn more about LibVortex see www.aspl.es/vortex

BEEP is a network application framework protocol. To understand exactly what that means, see www.beepcore.org and RFC3080.

Installing
----------
LibVortex uses LibAxl. Both the libraries must be installed following the included installation instructions.

Vortex (the pascal unit) does not need to be installed. It must only be included in the application's uses statement.

Vortex uses Axl, which must also be in the uses statement.

Obtaining the libraries
-----------------------
LibVortex can be downloaded from www.aspl.es/vortex.
LibAxl can be downloaded from www.aspl.es/axl.

Main differences with C headers
-------------------------------
The pascal units were kept as close as possible to the original source. The biggest changes are macros that are implemented as functions or skipped altogether.

Most of the C source are still in the files for future reference as well as all the doxygen documentation.

Work completed
--------------
This translation of the libvortex headers is for libvortex v1.1.1 svn r4012

The complete library was translated. A server (vortex-simple-listener) and a client application (vortex-simple-client) were translated to test the basic functionality.

To do
-----
1. There remain some untranslated #define's
2. Most of the test applications included with the library are not yet translated

Portability
-----------
Both libvortex and libaxl run on windows.

This tranlation has only been tested on linux. There remain some work in the Vortex unit for it to work under windows.

Credits and license
