LibAxl library for Free Pascal
Version 0.5.7

Copyright (C) 2009, Wimpie Nortje <wimpienortje@gmail.com>

Introduction
------------
This package is a Free Pascal translation of the libaxl header files.

AXL (another XML library) is an XML library implemented in C. The reason for this translation is because it is used by LibVortex (a BEEP implementation).

Installing
----------
The Pascal axl units do not need to be installed, only included in the uses statement.

LibAxl shared library must be installed. See the library for instructions.

Obtaining libaxl
----------------
LibAxl can be downloaded from www.aspl.es/axl

Main differences with C headers
-------------------------------
The pascal units were kept as close as possible to the original source. The biggest changes are macros that are implemented as functions or skipped altogether.

Most of the C source are still in the files for future reference as well as all the doxygen documentation.

Work completed
--------------
This translation of the libaxl headers is for libaxl v0.5.7

Only the base library was translated. This is the part required by LibVortex to operate.

To do
-----
1. There remain some untranslated #define's in the base library
2. The following axl parts are not yet translated:
  - babel
  - knife
  - namespace
  - tests

Credits and license
-------------------
Thanks to Advanced Software Production Line (ASPL) for making this library available.

This translation uses the same LGPL license as the libaxl library.
