README FOR External OPM JSON package Editor
===========================================

* This application is for component writers who wish to publish updates for the Online Package Manager.

* The json file can be manually edited, but this GUI application can make and edit the JSON file so that it is always correct for OPM.

* On startup it will create an \updates folder which can be used as your deployment folder for the updated app.

* By default, it will start up in either Spanish or English (depending on your setup) and this can be changed via the Help menu item "Languages"

* On first run only, it will show tooltips to help you understand how to fill out the entries.  They can be re-enabled at any time in the Help menu.
