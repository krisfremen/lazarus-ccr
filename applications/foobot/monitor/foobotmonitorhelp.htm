<h1>Foobot Monitor</h1>
<p>Welcome to Foobot Monitor - a desktop application to display information from 
your Foobot(s).</p>
<p>Foobot Monitor is available for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit editions, and also 
Linux 32-bit and 64-bit editions.&nbsp; It is compatible with Windows Vista, 
Windows 8 and Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was written as a hobby project using 
the excellent FreePascal compiler with the equally excellent Lazarus IDE.&nbsp; 
Licence is GPL
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">(information 
here)</a> It is distributed as freeware.</p>
<h2>QuickStart</h2>
<ul>
	<li>On first start-up, Foobot Monitor will present a dialog asking for your Foobot 
Username and an API Key.</li>
	<li>Foobot supplies an API Key for any Foobot owner that requests it from their 
site. Go to <a href="http://api.foobot.io/apidoc/index.html">the Foobot API page</a>, 
	and you will see easy-to-follow instructions for obtaining your own API Key.&nbsp; 
	Once you have it, save it to a text file, and when the Foobot Monitor dialog comes up you 
can Copy/Paste it into the dialog.&nbsp; Once that is done, you need to restart Foobot Monitor and it will automatically use the information you entered every 
time it starts.</li>
	<li>Foobot Monitor stores the information in an encrypted configuration file.&nbsp; 
In Windows, this file is located in &lt;username&gt;AppData\local\Foobot monitor\foobotmonitor.cfg.&nbsp; 
In Linux it is usually located in your home directory/-conf/foobotmonitor.cfg 
	(depends on Linux distribution)</li>
	<li>If for some reason you wish to change/update your login and/or API Key, 
there are two ways of doing it:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Delete the cfg file, and restart&nbsp; Foobot Monitor.&nbsp; You will be 
	prompted with the login dialog as before.&nbsp; As a consequence you will 
	lose any saved settings you had before.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Open the foobotmonitor.cfg file<br />
	Make a new entry thus, then save the file. (using your values instead of the 
	example &lt;..&gt; ones) </p>
	<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr">
		<div class="delphi source-delphi">
			<pre class="de1"><span class="br0">[</span>Config<span class="br0">]</span>
Foobot User<span class="sy3">=</span>&lt;username&gt;
Secret Key<span class="sy3">=</span>&lt;Secret API Key&gt;</pre>
		</div>
	</div>
	Next time Foobot Monitor is run, these values are read, then encrypted and 
	the plaintext is deleted <br />
	You can do this as many times as you like </li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Once running, Foobot Monitor should locate your Foobot(s) and display current 
readings, as well as a graph showing the last 48 hours of readings.&nbsp; By 
default, Foobot Monitor will fetch a new reading every hour and add it to the 
graph.</li>
	<li>Notice the status bar at the bottom of the window. Running your mouse over 
the various parts of Foobot Monitor panels will display useful information.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Foobot Menus</h2>
<p><strong>The File menu</strong> contains one item: Exit.</p>
<p><strong>The Foobot men</strong>u has a list of your Foobots.&nbsp; Click the 
Foobot name to change the Foobot the application uses.&nbsp; It also takes an 
instant reading.</p>
<p><strong>The Help menu</strong> has links to this help, the Foobot Monitor home page, 
Foobot&#39;s API page and an &#39;About&#39; dialog.</p>
<h4>The Options menu</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The Options menu is where you can customise Foobot Monitor to your liking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minimise to Tray:</strong> Foobot Monitor can run as a System Tray 
icon when you need more screen space.&nbsp; Just click the tray icon to restore 
Foobot Monitor. You can also right-click the tray icon to show a small menu.</p>
<p><strong>Take Reading Now:</strong> This will update Foobot Monitor&#39;s display 
with current information 
when clicked.&nbsp; Note: Foobot only sends data to the Foobot server every 6 
minutes or so.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Every...:</strong> By default, Foobot Monitor fetches a fresh 
reading every hour, but this can be changed via this submenu,</p>
<p><strong>Display... Minimal View:</strong> This will collapse/expand Foobot 
Monitor to a smaller screen footprint.</p>
<p><strong>Display... Recommended Values:</strong>&nbsp; This will show yellow 
lines on the gauges corresponding to the &#39;recommended values&#39;.&nbsp; The 
recommended values can be tweaked via the &#39;Set Triggers and Recommended Values&#39; 
dialog (see below)</p>
<p><strong>Display... Session Maximums:</strong> This will show red lines on the 
gauges corresponding to the maximum values read whilst Foobot Monitor has been 
running.&nbsp; These are reset when Foobot Monitor is restarted.</p>
<p><strong>Record All-time High/Lows:</strong> (Default=ON)&nbsp; This 
setting controls the &#39;All-time Highs and Lows&#39; panel - whether it updates or 
not.</p>
<p><strong>Reset All-time Highs and Lows:</strong> Clicking this zeros out the 
&#39;All-time Highs and Lows&#39; panel.&nbsp; Depending on the &#39;Record..&#39; menu it will 
then populate itself as Foobot Monitor runs.</p>
<p><strong>Foobot Triggers and Recommended Values.. Set Trigger and Recommended 
Values:</strong> This opens a dialog where you can change any or all the values 
Foobot Monitor uses.&nbsp; This information takes effect immediately and is also 
used next time Foobot Monitor starts.</p>
<p><strong>Foobot Triggers and Recommended Values.. Set Triggers On/off:</strong> 
Turns off triggering for all Foobots</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Q. <strong>Can Foobot Monitor be run from a thumb drive?&nbsp; What 
	files are required?</strong><br />
	A. The only file required is foobotmonitor(.exe).&nbsp; It can be located 
	anywhere in your file system (including thumb drives or non-writable media)&nbsp; 
	On start-up, it will create config files and a help file on your main 
	system&#39;s config directory.</li>
	<li>Q. <strong>Can Foobot Monitor be run without an internet connection?</strong><br />
	A. Foobot Monitor requires an internet connection to acquire data from the 
	Foobot server.</li>
	<li>Q. <strong>What is a &quot;trigger&quot; in Foobot Monitor?&nbsp; What does it do?</strong><br />
	A. As an example; let&#39;s say you set a &quot;High Trigger&quot; for temperature at 26C, 
	and a &quot;Low Trigger&quot; at 20C.&nbsp; If Foobot Monitor receives a temperature 
	of more than 26C or less than 20C, the temperature sensor will change colour 
	and the &#39;traffic light&#39; will show red.</li>
	<li>Q. <strong>What is a &quot;Recommended Value&quot; in Foobot Monitor?</strong><br />
	A. Each sensor has a &#39;recommended value&#39; and if Foobot Monitor detects above 
	or below this value the traffic lights show yellow and green respectively.</li>
	<li>Q. <strong>Can I change Foobot Monitor&#39;s default recommended values and 
	triggers?</strong><br />
	A. Certainly. From the Options menu, click &quot;<em>Foobot Triggers and Recommended 
	Values../Set Trigger and Recommended Values</em>&quot; and you can configure them to 
	your liking.&nbsp; Note that Recommended Values apply to all Foobots, but 
	Triggers are unique to each Foobot.</li>
	<li>Q.<strong> I have a problem with my Foobot Monitor.&nbsp; Can I expect to get it 
	fixed?</strong><br />
	A. Foobot Monitor is freeware distributed under a GPL license.&nbsp; Unpaid 
	support is not included, however a polite email with full details of the 
	error, the Foobot Monitor version and the system running Foobot Monitor may get attention.&nbsp; My 
	email address is in the cfg file.&nbsp; From time to time updates will be 
	posted - check your version of Foobot Monitor - it is in the Help/About 
	menu.</li>
	<li>Q. <strong>I want to write my own version of Foobot Monitor.&nbsp; Is 
	the source code available?</strong><br />
	A. Yes.&nbsp; Go to the Home Page (Help menu/Home Page) for details.</li>
	<li>Q. <strong>Is Foobot Monitor supported or sponsored by the makers of 
	Foobot?</strong><br />
