<h1>Foobot Monitor</h1>
<p>Welcome to Foobot Monitor - a desktop application to display information from 
your Foobot(s).</p>
<p>Foobot Monitor is available for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit editions, and also 
Linux 32-bit and 64-bit editions.&nbsp; It is compatible with Windows Vista, 
Windows 8 and Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was written as a hobby project using 
the excellent FreePascal compiler with the equally excellent Lazarus IDE.&nbsp; 
Licence is GPL
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">(information 
here)</a> It is distributed as freeware.</p>
<h2>QuickStart</h2>
<p>On first startup, Foobot Monitor will present a dialog asking for your Foobot 
Username and an API Key.</p>
<p>Foobot supplies an API Key for any Foobot owner that requests it from their 
site. Go to <a href="http://api.foobot.io/apidoc/index.html">the Foobot API page</a>, 
and you will see easy-to-follow instructions for obtaining your own API Key.&nbsp; 
Once you have it, save it to a text file, and when the FM dialog comes up you 
can Copy/Paste it into the dialog.&nbsp; Once that is done, you need to restart 
Foobot Monitor and it will automatically use the information you entered every 
time it starts.</p>
<p>Foobot Monitor stores the information in an encrypted configuration file.&nbsp; 
In Windows, this file is located in %APPDATA%\username\local\foobotmonitor\foobotmonitor.cfg.&nbsp; 
In Linux it is located in your home directory/-conf/foobotmonitor.cfg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If for some reason you wish to change/update your login and/or API Key, 
there are two ways of doing it:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Delete the cfg file, and resart&nbsp; Foobot Monitor.&nbsp; You will be 
	prompted with the login dialog as before.&nbsp; As a consequence you will 
	lose any saved settings you had before.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Open the foobotmonitor.cfg file<br />
	Make a new entry thus, then save the file. (using your values instead of the 
	example &lt;..&gt; ones) </p>
	<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr">
		<div class="delphi source-delphi">
			<pre class="de1"><span class="br0">[</span>Config<span class="br0">]</span>
Foobot User<span class="sy3">=</span>&lt;username&gt;
Secret Key<span class="sy3">=</span>&lt;Secret API Key&gt;</pre>
		</div>
	</div>
	Next time Foobot Monitor is run, these values are read, then encrypted and 
	the plaintext is deleted <br />
	You can do this as many times as you like </li>
</ol>
<p>Once running,Foobot Monitor should locate your Foobot(s) and display current 
readings, as well as a graph showing the last 48 hours of readings.&nbsp; By 
default, Foobot Monitor will fetch a new reading every hour and add it to the 
graph.</p>
<p>* Notice the status bar at the bottom of the window. Running your mouse over 
the various parts of Foobot Monitor panels will display useful information.</p>

<h2>Foobot Menus</h2>
<p><strong>The File menu</strong> contains one item: Exit.</p>
<p><strong>The Foobot men</strong>u has a list of your Foobots.&nbsp; Click the 
Foobot name to change the Foobot the application uses.&nbsp; It also takes an 
instant reading.</p>
<p><strong>The Help menu</strong> has links to the Foobot Monitor home page, 
Foobot&#39;s API page and an &#39;About&#39; dialog.</p>
<h4>The Options menu</h4>
<p>The Options menu is where you can customise Foobot Monitor to your liking.</p>
<p><strong>Minimise to Tray:</strong> Foobot Monitor can run as a System Tray 
icon when you need more screen space.&nbsp; Just click the tray icon to restore 
Foobot Monitor. You can also right-click the tray icon to show a small menu.</p>
<p><strong>Take Reading Now:</strong> This will update Foobot Monitor instantly 
when clicked.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Every...:</strong> By default, Foobot Monitor fetches a fresh 
reading every hour, but this can be changed via this submenu,</p>
<p><strong>Display... Minimal View:</strong> This will collapse/expand Foobot 
Monitor to a smaller screen footprint.</p>
<p><strong>Display... Recommended Values:</strong>&nbsp; This will show yellow 
lines on the gauges corresponding to the &#39;recommended values&#39;.&nbsp; The 
recommended values can be tweaked via the &#39;Set Triggers and Recommended Values&#39; 
dialog (see below)</p>
<p><strong>Display... Session Maximums:</strong> This will show red lines on the 
gauges corresponding to the maximum values read whilst Foobot Monitor has been 
running.&nbsp; These are reset when Foobot Monitor is restarted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Record All-time High/Lows:</strong> (Default=ON)&nbsp; This 
setting controls the &#39;All-time Highs and Lows&#39; panel - whether it updates or 
not.</p>
<p><strong>Reset All-time Highs and Lows:</strong> Clicking this zeros out the 
&#39;All-time Highs and Lows&#39; panel.&nbsp; Depending on the &#39;Record..&#39; menu it will 
then populate itself as Foobot Monitor runs.</p>
<p><strong>Foobot Triggers and Recommended Values.. Set Trigger and Recommended 
Values:</strong> This opens a dialog where you can change any or all the values 
Foobot Monitor uses.&nbsp; This information takes effect immediately and is also 
used next time Foobot Monitor starts.</p>
<p><strong>Foobot Triggers and Recommended Values.. Set Triggers On/off:</strong> 
Recommended Values apply to all Foobots you have in your system, whereas 
Triggers are set on a per-Foobot basis.</p>
