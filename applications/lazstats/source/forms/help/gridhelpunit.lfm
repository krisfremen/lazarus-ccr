      'When you start LazStats you will see the grid with one empty cell.  The column represents a variable and the row represents a "case", observation or subject of your study.  Before you enter a value in that first cell, you should click on the Variables menu and select the Define Variables option.  You will see a form that lets you specify a name or label for the variable as well as a longer title for the variable.  In addition, you specify the type of variable (integer, floating point, character string), a missing value, and how you want the values entered to be displayed in the cell (justification.)  Default values are provided but you can change these by clicking on a specification and entering your own.  There are also "drop-down" boxes that let you select the type or justification for those specifications.  It is a good idea to define all of your variables before you begin entering data.  You can add additional variables in the Definition form by simply pressing the down arrow key on your key board and then change any default values to appropriate ones for your data.'
      ''
      'Once you have specified the variables for the data grid and returned to the grid, you can then enter data for those variables you have defined.  When you press the down arrow key on your keyboard, a new row will automatically appear to enter the next case.  BE CAREFUL!  It is easy to accidentally add new (blank) lines that should not be a part of your data file.  Use the Edit menu and select the Delete Row for any row accidentally added to the grid.'
      ''
      'Avoid leaving any cell blank.  It is recommended that you use a value such as 99999 as a missing value until you have the correct value for that case and variable.  Generally, it is NOT a good idea to have any missing data since not all procedures will work with missing data.'
      ''
      'Once you have entered data (or need to take a break from data entry) it is time to save the grid data into a disk file.  It is recommended that you save your data as a .LAZ file (the top option under the FILE menu.)  This saves not only your data but also all of your variable definitions!  You can, of course, also export your data to a .TAB or other file format commonly utilized by other programs.  These other formats do NOT save the definitions of the variables!'
      ''
      'Once you have entered data in a grid you will discover it is easy to "navigate" around the grid.  Use the "home" key, "end" key, "page up" and "page down" keys as needed.  The "TAB" key will move you from cell to cell in a case.  You will also find procedures under the Variables menu and the Edit menu that lets you recode values in the grid, insert, copy and delete rows or columns, transform values in the grid, etc. Experiment!  Try different options.  There''s not much you can do to harm your computer with this program.'
